            <h1>Industry Analysis</h1><br/>
            <p>
                The website development industry is currently very promising for new ventures like Bracket Artistry. The increased usage in online mediums due to the Covid-19 pandemic has provided a window of opportunity. Many businesses and individuals who were without an online presence, now desire websites to advertise their products or services and Bracket Artistry can cater to this need.
            </p>

            <p>
                However, customers typically encounter some problems when trying to purchase website development services online. These issues include the process seeming too difficult/technical and miscommunication between clients and developers leading to websites which are undesirable based on their needs. Bracket Artistry avoids these problems by having a simple but effective user interface which allows customers to choose the exact features they want and by providing one-on-one consultations via Zoom so Bracket Artistry’s developers can gain a better understanding of the client’s needs. These features put Bracket Artistry in a unique position in the industry.
            </p>
            <p>
                At present, it would be difficult for many of Bracket Artistry’s competitors, such as Upwork and Fiverr, to replicate the more reliable client-developer interaction due to the fact that outsourcing the development process is at the heart of their business models. These freelancers are not usually vetted by the company and sometimes may “ghost” clients.
